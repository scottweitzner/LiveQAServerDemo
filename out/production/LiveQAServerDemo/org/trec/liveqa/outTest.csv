One of my fav rockers of the 70s, gospel singer Larry Norman said in the song Why Should the devil Have All the Good Music: Some yell to cut your hair, they drive me insane, others grow it out long and make room for the brain...",Men with mid-length hair isn&#39;t manly?,Beauty & Style,"From timw to time I hear people saying that men with mid-length hair is not a man. That man should have short hair (like guys in the military). Do you agree with that? What makes man being a &quot;man&quot;? If man with mid-length hair is a professional boxer, gentleman with women, knows how the basic of repairing stuff and building, protects his family and dont go back on his words. He&#39;s not a man or manly because of the hairstyle? I don&#39;t think so. What&#39;s you opinion?",Sun Jun 07 05:33:13 EDT 2015
